# React Handpan Project

React is a powerful rendering engine that lets us create apps for the web effectively.
With it we can build a handpan and a step sequencer so players can create patterns on a sequencer and play it back on the handpan on the screen.
One of the problems with the handpan world is that it's difficult to choose which scale to buy. Uncommon scales are hard to come by so you might have to travel to go play one.

Folk could benefit from being able to "try out" different scales either by tapping on their screen or by using the step sequencer to build melodies.

A stretch goal would be allow them to record their handpan player and detect the notes being played, map those to midi, then play the same patterns (of hand movements) to a different handpan... that would be cool.

# Files to ignore (For now)

For now, let's ignore a few files, allow them to be magic voodoo files and we'll circle back to them once we find a need to and learn more about them when that times comes for each.

Those are `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tslint.json`, `webpack.config.js`, `yarn.lock`, `yarn-error.log`.

Most of this is just standard configuration across many projects and lets you work with and fine tune the app in different ways.
I think it's important we get our bearings comfortably with the other stuff first then look at this stuff later.
