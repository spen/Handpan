# Typescript

Typescript has a sort of layer-on-top relationship to the JavaScript language itself. That's why in this project you'll see a lot of .ts and .tsx files. You can see them as being the same as a .js, or .jsx file types, but with an added set of rules that TypeScript assumes. Those rules are sort of optional in that you don't have to impose them everywhere, or on every file, but it's beneficial that you do, as it makes you write safer and better organised code in the long run.

So we'll all be learning this together. I have this massive book with me that covers everything there is to know about it, so as we have problems, I'll be able to find answers, or we look on stack overflow or whatever.

If any of us find we're not really understanding some part of the code, let's make a point of thinking about it together and figuring it out. And let's keep a list below of resources that are helpful
