# Next Steps

Where do we go from here?

I've already set up the project with a handful of useful open source libraries and packages that we'll make use of we build new features and gizmos likes sound, synths, MIDI etc. 

Let's keep track of feature ideas and their progress either on the issues board or a PR or something (we'll figure it out as we go).
Here's an example of an issue being used for a [feature request](https://github.com/spen/Handpan/issues/4).
If you have any ideas it's always good to  open an issue to kick off a discussion about it there early, so that if we absolutely can't do it we've not wasted time coding it anyway (as we would have done if we just did all the work before discussing).

I'll slowly start adding issues to the project with different goals or discussion points :)

For now, feel free to poke around the project. It should auto reload in the browser when you save changes, so have a go at changing things or adding new html or styles etc.

Start thinking about where in the project you would add new things. Like if we were adding the step sequencer, where would you do that?
We'll also get in to how we would break up a step sequencer in to its smaller components - that'll be a good exercise for us to start thinking about this any time and contributing on [the issue](https://github.com/spen/Handpan/issues/4) from earlier.
